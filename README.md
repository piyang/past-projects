# past-projects
This repository contains work I have done for past labs and assignments in my computer science classes.
DigitalClock and CarRentalAgency were done as group projects and thus the work seen there was a collaborative effort.
BankingApp was written and constructed by me alone, as it was the final project for a previous class.
